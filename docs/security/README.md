## 🎯 Security Principles

### 🛡️ **Core Security Principles**
1. **Zero Trust Architecture** - Never trust, always verify
2. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Least Privilege Access** - Minimal permissions for all users and services
4. **Security by Design** - Security integrated from the ground up
5. **Continuous Monitoring** - Real-time threat detection and response

### 📋 **Security Standards**
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication required
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and real-time alerting
- **Incident Response**: 15-minute response time for critical incidents

---
