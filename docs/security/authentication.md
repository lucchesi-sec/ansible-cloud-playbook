# Authentication & Access Control

## Overview

This document outlines the authentication mechanisms and access control policies for the Ansible Network Automation Platform.

## Essential Security Controls

### SSH-Based Authentication
- **Key Management**: RSA 4096-bit keys for all network device access
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enforced for administrative access
- **Certificate-Based Access**: X.509 certificates for service accounts

### Access Control Framework
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions by user role
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions only
- **Just-In-Time Access**: Temporary elevated permissions with audit trails

## Authentication Mechanisms

### Device Authentication
```yaml
# Example SSH configuration
ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/cisco_rsa
ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
ansible_user: admin
```

### Vault Integration
- **Ansible Vault**: Encrypted credential storage
- **External Secret Management**: Integration with enterprise password vaults
- **Credential Rotation**: Automated key rotation procedures

## Implementation Guidelines

Refer to the [Security Implementation Guide](implementation.md) for detailed configuration procedures.
