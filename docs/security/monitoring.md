# Security Monitoring & SIEM

## Overview

Comprehensive security monitoring framework for the Ansible Network Automation Platform, including real-time threat detection and incident response capabilities.

## Security Monitoring Framework

### Core Monitoring Components
- **SIEM Integration**: Centralized security event correlation
- **Real-time Alerting**: Automated threat detection and notification
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Continuous regulatory compliance validation
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration with external threat feeds

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Failed authentication attempts
- Privilege escalation events
- Configuration changes
- Network traffic anomalies
- Vault access patterns

## Executive Security Dashboard

### High-Level Security Metrics
- **Security Posture Score**: Overall platform security health
- **Threat Level**: Current threat assessment (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- **Compliance Status**: Regulatory compliance percentage
- **Incident Response Time**: Average response to security events

### Operational Security Metrics
- **Failed Login Rate**: Authentication failure trends
- **Configuration Drift**: Unauthorized configuration changes
- **Vulnerability Exposure**: Open security vulnerabilities
- **Access Pattern Analysis**: Unusual access behaviors

## Monitoring Configuration

### Log Collection
```yaml
# Security log aggregation
security_monitoring:
  syslog_server: security-logs.company.com
  log_level: INFO
  retention_days: 365
```

### Alert Thresholds
- **Failed Logins**: > 5 attempts in 10 minutes
- **Privilege Changes**: Any elevation or role modification
- **Off-Hours Access**: Access outside business hours
- **Configuration Changes**: Any unauthorized modifications
