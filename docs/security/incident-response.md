# Security Incident Response

## Overview

Comprehensive incident response procedures for security events within the Ansible Network Automation Platform.

## Incident Response Procedures

### 1. Incident Detection & Classification
- **Automated Detection**: SIEM alerts and monitoring systems
- **Manual Reporting**: User-reported security concerns
- **Severity Classification**: Critical, High, Medium, Low

### 2. Initial Response
```bash
# Immediate containment steps
ansible-playbook playbooks/security_incident_response.yml \
  --extra-vars "incident_type=security_breach"

# Isolate affected systems
ansible-playbook playbooks/network_isolation.yml \
  --limit affected_devices
```

### 3. Investigation & Analysis
- **Evidence Collection**: Automated log gathering and preservation
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Systematic investigation procedures
- **Impact Assessment**: Scope and severity determination

### 4. Containment & Eradication
- **Threat Containment**: Immediate threat isolation
- **System Hardening**: Vulnerability remediation
- **Recovery Planning**: Service restoration procedures

## Incident Containment

### Network Isolation
```yaml
# Emergency network isolation
network_isolation:
  action: isolate
  target_devices: "{{ incident_devices }}"
  preserve_logs: true
  notification: security_team
```

### Access Revocation
- **Immediate Actions**: Disable compromised accounts
- **Certificate Revocation**: Invalidate compromised certificates
- **Session Termination**: Force logout of all active sessions

## Emergency Response Teams

### Security Operations Center (SOC)
- **Primary Contact**: security@company.com
- **Emergency Hotline**: +1-800-SEC-RITY
- **Escalation Path**: SOC → CISO → Executive Team

### Response Team Roles
- **Incident Commander**: Overall response coordination
- **Technical Lead**: Technical investigation and remediation
- **Communications Lead**: Stakeholder and regulatory notification
- **Legal Counsel**: Compliance and legal implications

## Communication Procedures

### Internal Notifications
- **Immediate**: SOC team, affected system owners
- **1 Hour**: Management team, CISO
- **4 Hours**: Executive team, legal counsel
- **24 Hours**: All staff (if organization-wide impact)

### External Notifications
- **Regulatory Bodies**: As required by compliance frameworks
- **Law Enforcement**: For criminal activities
- **Customers/Partners**: Based on impact assessment
- **Media**: Coordinated through corporate communications

## Recovery & Lessons Learned

### Post-Incident Activities
- **System Restoration**: Verified secure restoration of services
- **Monitoring Enhancement**: Improved detection capabilities
- **Documentation Update**: Incident response plan refinements
- **Training Update**: Staff training based on lessons learned
