## Domain-Driven Design Structure

### Proposed Security Domain Organization

```
docs/security/
├── README.md                 # Security domain overview and navigation
├── architecture.md           # Consolidated architecture content
├── authentication.md         # SSH, MFA, access control
├── secrets-management.md     # Vault, encryption, key management
├── monitoring.md            # Logging, alerting, SIEM
├── compliance.md            # Frameworks, governance, policies
├── implementation.md        # Implementation guides and procedures
├── operations.md            # Daily operations and SOC procedures
├── incident-response.md     # Incident management and recovery
├── risk-management.md       # Risk assessment and mitigation
├── checklist.md            # Validation scripts and procedures
└── emergency-procedures.md  # Emergency response protocols
```

### Bounded Context Definitions

#### 1. **Security Architecture Context**
- **Files**: `architecture.md`, `authentication.md`, `secrets-management.md`
- **Scope**: Technical security design and implementation patterns
- **Boundaries**: System design, not operational procedures

#### 2. **Security Operations Context**
- **Files**: `operations.md`, `monitoring.md`, `incident-response.md`
- **Scope**: Day-to-day security operations and response
- **Boundaries**: Operational activities, not strategic planning

#### 3. **Security Governance Context**
- **Files**: `compliance.md`, `risk-management.md`, `emergency-procedures.md`
- **Scope**: Governance, compliance, and risk management
- **Boundaries**: Policy and compliance, not technical implementation

#### 4. **Security Implementation Context**
- **Files**: `implementation.md`, `checklist.md`
- **Scope**: Implementation guidance and validation
- **Boundaries**: How-to guides, not theoretical frameworks

## Content Consolidation Plan

### Phase 1: Domain Structure Creation
1. Create `docs/security/` directory structure
2. Create domain index (`README.md`) with clear navigation
3. Set up cross-reference framework

### Phase 2: Content Migration and Consolidation
1. **Architecture Content**: Consolidate technical architecture materials
2. **Authentication Systems**: Merge SSH, MFA, and access control content
3. **Secrets Management**: Combine vault and encryption materials
4. **Monitoring Systems**: Merge logging and monitoring content

### Phase 3: Operations Consolidation
1. **Daily Operations**: Consolidate operational procedures
2. **Incident Response**: Merge incident management content
3. **Compliance Management**: Organize compliance frameworks

### Phase 4: Validation and Cross-referencing
1. Ensure all unique content preserved
2. Create cross-references between related sections
3. Validate domain boundaries and coherence

## Content That Doesn't Fit Security Domain

### Infrastructure Content
- Network architecture diagrams (belongs in Infrastructure domain)
- General Ansible configuration (belongs in Platform domain)
- Performance optimization (belongs in Operations domain)

### Business Content
- Training programs (belongs in Human Resources domain)
- Vendor management (belongs in Procurement domain)
- Executive reporting (belongs in Business domain)

---

## Recommendations for Other Agents

### Agent B (Infrastructure Domain)
- Review network segmentation content in security files
- Consider infrastructure security patterns
- Coordinate on shared network/security boundaries

### Agent C (Operations Domain)
- Review operational procedures in security files
- Consider security operations integration
- Coordinate on monitoring and alerting systems

### Agent D (Platform Domain)
- Review Ansible-specific security configurations
- Consider platform security integration
- Coordinate on automation and tooling

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Create domain directory structure
2. **Week 1**: Migrate and consolidate high-overlap content
3. **Week 2**: Organize unique content by bounded context
4. **Week 3**: Create cross-references and navigation
5. **Week 4**: Validate domain integrity and completeness
