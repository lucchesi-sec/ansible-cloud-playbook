- Performance optimization and bandwidth management
- Advanced routing features and multi-protocol support

#### Phase 4: Security & AI Implementation
- Micro-segmentation and zero-trust policies
- AI optimization and predictive analytics
- Identity-based networking and software-defined perimeter
- Event-driven automation and self-healing networks

#### Phase 5: Final Validation & Testing
- Comprehensive testing and security validation
- Performance benchmarking and compliance verification
- Connectivity testing and integration testing

#### Phase 6: Deployment Summary
- Final report generation and artifact collection
- Documentation creation and audit trail completion
- Handover documentation and support information

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Pre-deployment validation
ansible-playbook playbooks/validate_pre_deployment.yml -i inventory/production.yml

# Security audit
ansible-playbook playbooks/security_audit.yml -i inventory/production.yml

# Performance benchmark
ansible-playbook playbooks/performance_benchmark.yml -i inventory/production.yml

# Quick validation
ansible-playbook playbooks/validation_suite.yml -i inventory/production.yml
```

### Emergency Procedures
```bash
# Manual rollback
ansible-playbook playbooks/rollback_deployment.yml -i inventory/production.yml

# Diagnostic report
./verify_implementation.sh
```
