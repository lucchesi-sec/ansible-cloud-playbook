# Enterprise Network Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- Ansible 2.12+ with cisco.ios and cisco.nxos collections
- Python 3.8+ with required packages
- SSH access to all network devices
- Vault password file configured

## Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All target devices accessible via SSH
- [ ] Ansible vault password configured
- [ ] Inventory files validated
- [ ] Backup procedures verified
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## Quick Start

### Environment Setup
```bash
cd /path/to/ansible-cloud-playbook/src/final_implementation
ansible --version
ansible all -i inventory/production.yml -m ping
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
./deploy_enterprise.sh --environment production --vault-password vault-password-script.sh
./deploy_enterprise.sh --environment production --verbose  # With verbose logging
```

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
./deploy_enterprise.sh --rollback --environment production
```

## Deployment Phases

1. **Infrastructure Validation**: Connectivity testing, inventory validation
2. **Core Network**: Router configuration, security hardening, BGP, QoS
3. **Advanced Features**: Leaf-spine architecture, VXLAN overlay, performance optimization
4. **Security & AI**: Micro-segmentation, zero-trust, AI optimization
5. **Final Validation**: Comprehensive testing, security verification
6. **Summary**: Final reporting, artifact collection

## Environment Configurations

- **Production**: Serial limit 1, full validation, comprehensive backup
- **Staging**: Serial limit 5, comprehensive testing, detailed validation
- **Development**: Serial limit 10, basic validation, rapid deployment

## Security Features
- Ansible Vault encryption for all sensitive data
- Role-based access control and audit trails
- Security hardening and zero-trust implementation
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Troubleshooting
- Review deployment logs in logs/ directory
- Check README.md troubleshooting section for common issues
- Validate prerequisites and inventory before deployment
- Use dry-run mode: `./deploy_enterprise.sh --dry-run`

## Emergency Procedures
1. **Deployment Failure**: Execute immediate rollback
2. **Partial Deployment**: Check phase reports in logs directory
3. **Connectivity Issues**: Run pre-deployment validation
4. **Configuration Issues**: Review device-specific logs

## Success Criteria
- All 6 phases complete without errors
- All 19 infrastructure roles deployed successfully
- All devices pass post-deployment validation
- Configuration backups created successfully
- Final deployment summary generated

## Support
For issues: Review logs, check troubleshooting guides, validate configuration
