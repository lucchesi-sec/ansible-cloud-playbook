## Pre-Deployment Phase

### Infrastructure Readiness
- [ ] All network devices accessible via SSH
- [ ] SSH keys properly configured and tested
- [ ] Network connectivity verified
- [ ] DNS resolution working for all device hostnames

### Security Validation
- [ ] Ansible Vault password file exists and accessible
- [ ] All sensitive variables encrypted with vault
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in configuration files
- [ ] SSH key permissions secured (600)

### Configuration Management
- [ ] Inventory files validated (production.yml, security_ai.yml)
- [ ] Group variables properly configured
- [ ] Host variables defined for all target devices
- [ ] Role dependencies validated
- [ ] Playbook syntax checked

### Backup and Recovery
- [ ] Current device configurations backed up
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented

## Deployment Phase

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks passing
- [ ] Ansible-lint validation successful
- [ ] YAML syntax validation passed
- [ ] Security audit completed

### Deployment Execution
- [ ] Change management approval obtained
- [ ] Deployment window scheduled
- [ ] Monitoring systems prepared
- [ ] Emergency rollback procedures ready

### Phase Validation
- [ ] Phase 1: Infrastructure validation completed
- [ ] Phase 2: Core network deployment successful
- [ ] Phase 3: Advanced features configured
- [ ] Phase 4: Security and AI implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Final validation passed
- [ ] Phase 6: Deployment summary generated

## Post-Deployment Phase

### Validation and Testing
- [ ] All devices responding to management access
- [ ] Network connectivity verified end-to-end
- [ ] Routing protocols converged properly
- [ ] Security policies applied and functional
- [ ] Performance baselines established

### Documentation and Reporting
- [ ] Deployment logs archived
- [ ] Configuration changes documented
- [ ] Performance metrics captured
- [ ] Security audit report generated

## Emergency Procedures

> ðŸš¨ **Emergency Rollback**: `./deploy_enterprise.sh --rollback --environment production`  
> ðŸ“ž **Emergency Contacts**: See [Security Operations Guide](../../SECURITY_OPERATIONS.md#emergency-response-procedures)

### Rollback Triggers
- [ ] Critical service unavailable
- [ ] Security breach detected  
- [ ] Performance degradation beyond thresholds

### Quick Recovery Commands
```bash
# Emergency rollback
./deploy_enterprise.sh --rollback --environment production

# Validate current state
ansible-playbook playbooks/validation_suite.yml -i inventory/production.yml

# Check security status
ansible-playbook playbooks/security_audit.yml -i inventory/production.yml
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 19 infrastructure roles deployed successfully
- [ ] Zero deployment errors or failures
- [ ] All network services operational
- [ ] Security hardening applied and verified
- [ ] Performance meets baseline requirements
- [ ] Documentation complete and current

Production deployment considered successful when all checklist items complete
