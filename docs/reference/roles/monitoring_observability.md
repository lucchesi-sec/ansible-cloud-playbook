# Monitoring & Observability Architecture

## Overview

Enterprise-scale monitoring and observability system designed for zero-trust network infrastructure with microservices architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles.

## Architecture Components

### Bounded Contexts
1. **Metrics Collection Domain** - Telemetry ingestion and processing
2. **Alert Management Domain** - Rule-based alerting and notification
3. **Visualization Domain** - Dashboard and analytics
4. **Log Processing Domain** - Centralized logging and correlation

### Integration Targets
- Prometheus (time-series metrics)
- Grafana (visualization and dashboards)
- ELK Stack (logging and search)
- InfluxDB (high-cardinality metrics)
- Jaeger (distributed tracing)

### Data Sources
- SNMP (network devices)
- gNMI (streaming telemetry)
- Syslog (system logs)
- NetFlow/sFlow (traffic analysis)
- API metrics (REST/GraphQL)

## Role Dependencies
- Integrates with existing `performance_optimization` role
- Extends `security_hardening` for audit logging
- Leverages `ai_network_intelligence` for predictive analytics
- Works with all 19 infrastructure roles
